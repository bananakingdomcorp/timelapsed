# Directions:

#Locmemcache will be used as a caching service. When we make changes in our signals we will write that data into locmemcache. 
#When we are ready to return a response we will build a response from our locmemcache and return it. This allows us to return 
#any and all changes to cards in one response. 

#In production, we may want to switch to memcached. 

#Need to think a lot about thread safety and especially locks in this function.
